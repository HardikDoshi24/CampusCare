College Reporting System Website
This is the College Reporting System, a comprehensive web application built using ReactJS for the frontend, Spring Boot for the backend, and MySQL Database for data storage, with Tailwind CSS for styling. This platform empowers college students to submit complaints or reports regarding damaged entities within their campus classrooms or laboratories effortlessly.

With a user-friendly interface, students can seamlessly navigate through the system to report any issues they encounter, ensuring a streamlined process for addressing campus maintenance needs. The platform allows students to provide detailed descriptions of the damaged entities, enabling maintenance staff to address the reported issues promptly and efficiently.

Moreover, students have access to a personalized history section, where they can review their past reports and track the status of each complaint. This feature enhances transparency and accountability, providing students with visibility into the resolution process.

By leveraging modern technologies and intuitive design, the College Reporting System aims to enhance campus maintenance operations, foster a collaborative environment between students and maintenance staff, and ultimately contribute to a safer and more conducive learning environment within the college campus.
